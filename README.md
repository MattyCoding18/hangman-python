# Hangman Game - Python Terminal 🎮

## Overview
This is a simple command-line Hangman game built in Python. The game selects a random word, and the player must guess the letters within a limited number of attempts. It features ASCII art for visual feedback and tracks remaining lives.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- ASCII art to display hangman stages
- Tracks incorrect guesses and remaining lives
- Prevents duplicate guesses
- Displays the word progressively as the player guesses correctly
